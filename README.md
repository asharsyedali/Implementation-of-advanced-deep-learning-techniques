# Implementation-of-advanced-deep-learning-techniques

Implementation of advanced deep learning techniques using Dice Loss and Focal Loss for optimal performance, including image patching and preprocessing.

---

## üìù Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a deep learning framework that leverages advanced techniques to achieve optimal performance in tasks like image processing and loss function optimization. Key aspects of the project include:

- Utilization of **Dice Loss** and **Focal Loss** to enhance model accuracy.
- Image patching and preprocessing using the `patchify` library.
- Data scaling techniques for effective feature normalization.
- Integration with Google Colab and Google Drive for seamless execution.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Loss Function Design**:
  - Combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss.
  - Total Loss = Dice Loss + Weighted Focal Loss.

- **Image Preprocessing**:
  - Uses `patchify` to divide images into smaller patches for better training.

- **Data Scaling**:
  - Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaling for normalization.

- **Notebook Execution**:
  - Fully compatible with Google Colab, with integration for Google Drive data storage.
